    "For concreteness I'll focus on an imaginary drug trial. To assess the effectiveness of a drug, we give some patients (\"the treatment group\") the drug and other patients (\"the control group\") a placebo, and look at the recovery rates. The idea is: if the recovery rate is higher in the treatment group than the control group, that's evidence that the drug is beneficial; if the recovery rate is lower in the treatment group than the control group, that's evidence that the drug is harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following scenario, surprising as it seems initially, is in fact possible: the recovery rate is higher in the treatment group than the control group, but lower among men in the treatment group than men in the control group *and* lower among women in the treatment group than women in the control group. Following Judea Pearl I'll call this phenomenon a *Simpson reversal*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When our data exhibit a Simpson reversal, what to conclude? We could go by the recovery rates overall, concluding that the drug is beneficial. Or we could go by the recovery rates in the two sub-populations, concluding that the drug is harmful. Pearl has argued (see e.g. \"Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference\") that the answer cannot be determined from the data itself, but depends in addition on the *causal story* behind the data. This debate is what makes Simpson reversals particularly interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data could exhibit not just one but indefinitely many Simpson reversals. For example, comparing treatment group and control group, there might be:\n",
    "  - overall, a *higher* recovery rate\n",
    "  - for men and for women, *lower* recovery rates\n",
    "  - for men over 50, men under 50, women over 50, and women under 50, *higher* recovery rates\n",
    "  - for men over 50 with a comorbidity, men over 50 without a comorbidity, men under 50 with a comorbidity, men under 50 without a combordity, women over 50 with a comorbidity, women over 50 without a comorbidity, women under 50 with a comorbidity, women under 50 without a combordity, *lower* recovery rates\n",

    "In general, a Simpson tree is an infinite binary tree at each node of which lives a column, represented by a tuple of its height and width. At the root node lives (1, 1), representing the entire population. It has two children, specified manually, representing the recovery rates and sizes of the treatment and control groups. Subsequent layers in the tree are generated on demand according to the recipe above, getting a Simpson reversal from each layer to the next."
